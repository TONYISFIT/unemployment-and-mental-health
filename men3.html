    <h1 id="toc_2">The Purpose of Pain, The Function of Feelings</h1>

      <p>&quot;Fear is a friend&quot;?! That sounds stupid ‚Äì even <em>morally offensive</em> ‚Äì to someone with near-daily panic attacks. So why am <em>I</em>, someone who knows this pain, saying something like <em>that?</em></p>

      <p>To understand this, imagine putting your hand on a lit stove.</p>

      <p>üî•üëãüò∞</p>

      <p>Obviously: it would hurt.</p>

      <p>Less obvious: it&#39;s a <em>good thing</em> that it would hurt.</p>

      <p>Pain is an alarm system. It tells you when things are bad, <em>which is good.</em></p>

      <p>(FUN FACT: There&#39;s a rare condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain">congenital insensitivity to pain</a>, where people can&#39;t feel pain. As a result, adults with the condition have lots of wounds, burns, and broken bones. They&#39;re the lucky ones ‚Äì the rest are dead.)</p>

      <p>However, you&#39;d also want an alarm system to go off <em>before</em> harm is done. This alarm system is called &quot;fear&quot;. It&#39;s an alarm that predicts ‚Äì and tries to protect you from ‚Äì <em>future</em> harm.</p>

      <p>Harm to what? Your fundamental human needs:</p>
      <img src = "banners\Mental_Illness_V_Mental_Health_V1.png">

      <ol>
      <li><strong>Physical Needs</strong> ‚Äì survival, health, safety<br>
      (When threatened: üê∫ ‚ÄúWe&#39;re in danger!‚Äù)</li>
      <li><strong>Social Needs</strong> ‚Äì friends, family, lovers<br>
      (When threatened: üê∫ ‚ÄúNobody likes us!‚Äù)</li>
      <li><strong>&quot;Becoming A Better Person&quot; Needs</strong> ‚Äì learning, character growth, doing good for others<br>
      (When threatened: üê∫ ‚ÄúWe&#39;re a bad person!‚Äù)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>(This list of needs is <span style="text-decoration:line-through">something I pulled out my bum</span> a condensed version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</a> + <a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf">Self-Determination Theory [pdf]</a>)</p>

      <p>Here&#39;s my conjecture. It&#39;s not original, hundreds have said it before, but it still took me forever to learn:</p>

      <p><strong>üö® ALL FEELINGS ARE IMPERFECT SIGNALS ABOUT MET &amp; UNMET NEEDS. üö®</strong></p>

      <p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_accounts_of_emotion">functionalist view of emotions</a>. But, what do I mean by &quot;signal&quot;?</p>

      <p>Imagine a cafe. When a customer arrives, the bell above the entrance door gives a <em>ding</em> signal.</p>

      <p>Likewise, when a body/mind need is met ‚Äì or is about to ‚Äì we feel a Pleasure signal: joy, anticipation, curiosity, the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment, pride.</p>

      <p>Imagine a cafe&#39;s smoke alarm. When something in the kitchen is burning, it gives a <em>BEEP BEEP BEEP</em> signal.</p>

      <p>Likewise, when a body/mind need is <em>not</em> being met ‚Äì or is being threatened ‚Äì we feel a Pain signal: fear, loneliness, frustration, guilt, grief.</p>

      <p>But wait, isn&#39;t this just the same as &quot;your feelings are always valid&quot;? No, because <em>all signals can have false alarms</em>. Thus, negative feelings aren&#39;t <em>always</em> valid, but they aren&#39;t <em>always</em> irrational either. They&#39;re clues ‚Äì not to be taken as 100% literal truth, but not to be thrown out entirely either. (Have an over-sensitive alarm? We&#39;ll see how to &quot;re-calibrate&quot; your signals with Habits, in the next section)</p>

      <p>All my life, I thought mentally healthy people were just better at &quot;coping&quot; with &quot;negative&quot; emotions. <em>The very vocabulary of this idea is wrong.</em> <strong>The mentally healthy don&#39;t &quot;cope&quot; with emotions, they collaborate <em>with</em> them. They know how to listen to, act on, and re-calibrate the signals.</strong></p>

      <p>When the smoke alarm goes off:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>A healthy person knows to turn off the stove, open a window, and put baking soda over the grease fire. If the alarm&#39;s too sensitive, they&#39;ll move it somewhere further.</li>
      <li>An anxious person throws water over the grease fire and makes it worse. Or plugs their ears to not hear the alarm. Or smashes the alarm with a hammer. Or tries to rationally argue with the alarm about its distortions. Or decides to &quot;mindfully&quot; ignore it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once I understood feelings = alarms &amp; signals, I realized a lot of what I thought were emotions&#39; bugs were actually features! &quot;Negative&quot; emotions turn on by themselves and you can&#39;t turn them off at will ‚Äì <em>this is a good feature for an automatic smoke detector.</em> &quot;Positive&quot; emotions never last, they always re-adjust themselves to your new normal ‚Äì <em>this is a good feature for smart thermostats.</em></p>

      <p>A good life is not about minimizing Pain and maximizing Pleasure. That&#39;s like a cafe whose goal to minimize alarms &amp; maximize entrance-bell-ringing. Feelings are <em>NOT</em> the ends, they are the <em>means</em> to the ends: a fulfilling life.</p>

      <p>So that&#39;s why I claim &quot;fear is not an enemy, it&#39;s a friend.&quot; But what kind of friend is fear? The &quot;Man&#39;s [sic] Best Friend&quot; kind. In a sentence:</p>

      <p><strong>üê∫ FEAR IS A GUARD DOG FOR YOUR NEEDS. üê∫</strong></p>

      <p>When it yaps ‚Äúnobody likes us!‚Äù it&#39;s trying (however badly) to protect your need for belonging. When it yaps ‚Äúwe&#39;re bad people!‚Äù it&#39;s trying (very poorly) to protect your need for personal growth.</p>

      <p>(The idea of a sub-agent in your mind isn&#39;t as wacky as it sounds ‚Äì this thought&#39;s popped up independently in several fields: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">&quot;System 1 and System 2&quot;</a> in behavioral economics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind">&quot;The Elephant &amp; The Rider&quot;</a> in social psychology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">&quot;The Society of Mind&quot;</a> in cognitive science, etc)</p>

      <p>However, maybe you have a hyperactive dog that barks at shadows. It&#39;s not the dog&#39;s fault. Maybe in the past, it&#39;s been abused or neglected. But the dog genuinely wants to help you! That&#39;s its literal evolved function!</p>

      <p>It yaps because it&#39;s a battered shelter dog, and it needs you to help it heal.</p>

      <p>Sadly, many people&#39;s first response to the loud dog ‚Äì including mine ‚Äì was to lash out at it. But you can&#39;t beat the meanness out of a dog, or scare the fear out of it. (Note: <a href="http://dogscouts.org/base/tonto-site/uploads/2014/10/620_art_training_methods.pdf">this is also true for literal dog-training [pdf]</a>.)</p>

      <p>So... how <em>do</em> you train your dog?</p>
