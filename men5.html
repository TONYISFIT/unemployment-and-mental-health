  <h1 id="toc_4">9 Evidence-Based Mental Health Habits</h1>

     <p>This list is to help you start improving your mental health <em>today.</em> Nine sounds overwhelming, so just pick <em>one</em> habit from the list below, make a small, simple When‚ÜíThen plan, and track your progress for 66 days or until it becomes automatic. Then come back, pick another habit, repeat.</p>
     <h2 id="toc_5">Habits to get to know your wolf better</h2>

     <h3 id="toc_6">üòå Meditation:</h3>
     
     <p>Yeah it&#39;s a clich√© at this point, but meditation&#39;s been shown in meta-analyses to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/1809754">improve anxiety &amp; depression</a>.</p>
     
     <p>However, there&#39;s one clich√© about meditation worth dispelling: the goal is <em>NOT</em> &quot;clear your mind&quot;. Classic beginner mistake! The goal is to <em>observe</em> your mind, like a scientist: non-judgmentally. When the wolf starts howling ‚Äì and it will ‚Äì don&#39;t fear fear. Just listen. Observe.</p>
     
     <p>Though I was critiquing &quot;mindfulness&quot; earlier (or my mis-implementation of it), meditation actually <em>is</em> profoundly helpful to my life.</p>
     
     <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúAfter brushing my teeth in the morning, I will go to the living room and set a timer to meditate for 2 minutes.‚Äù</em></p>
     
     <p>Recommended: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqoxYKtEWEc">this 2-minute animated intro to meditation</a>.</p>
     
     <h3 id="toc_7">üìì Journaling:</h3>
     
     <p>Another clich√©, but writing about your emotions has been shown to moderately <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.518.1710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">improve psychological <em>and physical</em> health [pdf]</a>. Though, you have to write about your emotions <em>and try to understand them</em>. Expressing emotions without cognitive sense-making <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_Ullrich/publication/11212874_Journaling_about_stressful_events_Effects_of_cognitive_processing_and_emotional_expression/links/0fcfd5090027dd0d0a000000.pdf">seems to not help [pdf]</a>.</p>
     
     <p>Not sure how to begin journaling to understand your emotions? Here&#39;s a simple template:</p>
     
     <p><em>&quot;Today when [event], I felt [feeling] because it seemed to fulfill/challenge my need for [need]. Next time, I&#39;ll try [experiments around that need].&quot;</em></p>
     
     <p>Example: <em>&quot;Today when my friends all chatted without me, I felt insecure because it seemed to challenge my need for belonging. Next time, I&#39;ll try to fulfill my need for belonging either by speaking up more, or practicing being comfortable listening to my pals, actively and wholly, without needing to pipe up to prove my existence.&quot;</em></p>
     
     <p>(As much as I criticized &quot;challenging your thoughts&quot; earlier, <em>this</em> is where CBT shines. Knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">common cognitive distortions</a> and how to reframe them <em>does</em> help you make sense of the Pain signals. Just don&#39;t approach it like Debate Club, where the point of the game is to &quot;win&quot; by Well, Actually-ing your fear. The goal should be to help your fear <em>be a better helper</em>. Help it help you.)</p>
     
     <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúBefore going to sleep, I will write/draw about my feelings for 10 minutes.‚Äù</em></p>
     
     <p>„Éª„Éª„Éª</p>
     
     <p>Remember, fear is a guard dog for your needs. If you hear it barking &quot;we&#39;re in danger!&quot; but with no <em>specific</em> cause, it&#39;s likely your <em>general</em> physical needs are not being fully met. To reassure your inner dog, <em>you</em> can take care of those needs:</p>
     
    <h2 id="toc_8">Habits to protect your physical needs:</h2>

<p>Imagine if popsci magazines wrote, &quot;Wow! Getting your computer&#39;s hardware wet <em>can affect how well the software runs</em>.&quot; Or &quot;Wow! Having a lot of intensive software running <em>can make the hardware hot!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I feel about articles acting surprised that physical health affects mental health &amp; vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="toc_9">üò¥ Sleep:</h3>

      <p>If natural selection decided to knock you out unconscious for a third of your life, you&#39;d better <em>bet</em> there&#39;s a huge benefit to make that cost/benefit analysis work out.</p>

      <p>And it does. As the director of UC Berkeley‚Äôs Center for Human Sleep Science explains <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501144318">in his book</a>, a good night&#39;s sleep reduces your risk for heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s, depression, anxiety, and more. As a best-selling children&#39;s author once said, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781617750250">Go The F**k To Sleep</a>.‚Äù</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúWhen it&#39;s 10pm, I will turn off all my devices, and put them on charger, outside the bedroom, in a trash can, where they belong.‚Äù</em></p>

      <p>Recommended: <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">F.lux</a>. It&#39;s an app that changes your screens&#39; lights in evenings, because blue light messes up your sleep cycle.</p>

      <h3 id="toc_10">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise:</h3>

      <p>Jog. Hike. Play Frisbee. Just half an hour of moderate exercise a day is enough to give great benefits to your physical <em>and mental</em> health. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395616300383">A recent meta-analysis</a> shows that exercise reduces depression <em>as much as</em> than psychotherapy or medication!</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúAfter getting home in the evening, I&#39;ll go for a 10 minute stroll.‚Äù</em> (Remember: you can always increase duration/intensity of a habit later)</p>

      <h3 id="toc_11">üçÜ Eat:</h3>

      <p>Your gut bacteria makes 90% of your body&#39;s serotonin. So: you keep your microbes happy, they keep you happy, capiche? (See: this <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/feeding-minds">Mental Health Foundation report</a>)</p>

      <p>There&#39;s a zillion diets out there, but most of them aren&#39;t based on science... and the science is full of failed replications and p-hacking. Personally, I go with Michael Pollan&#39;s anti-diet diet: <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143114963/Michael-Pollan/Defense-Food">Eat food, not too much, mostly plants</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúBefore grocery shopping, I&#39;ll eat a fruit so I&#39;m not hungry and won&#39;t get tempted to buy chocolate-flavored Cheetos. Again.‚Äù</em></p>

      <p>„Éª„Éª„Éª</p>

      <p>Our physical needs are essential, but we&#39;re not just animals, we&#39;re <em>social</em> animals. So, if your guard dog barks &quot;nobody likes us!&quot; you can reassure it with these habits:</p>

      <h2 id="toc_12">Habits to protect your social needs:</h2>

      <p>High-quality social connections, not surprisingly, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455910/pdf/11524_2006_Article_44.pdf">reduces depression and anxiety [pdf]</a>. And &quot;surprisingly&quot;, it even <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316&amp;mod=article_inline">reduces your risk of an early death by 50%</a>. (Again, it shouldn&#39;t <em>still</em> be surprising that hardware affects software and software affects hardware)</p>

      <h3 id="toc_13">üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Talk To Friends</h3>

      <p>Some anecdote-not-data advice:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>Whenever <em>possible:</em> Real-Life Face-To-Face &gt; Videochat &gt; Phone Call &gt; Text/Email. </li>
      <li>Meet with friends <em>outside</em> your usual context. Examples: meet a friend from work <em>outside</em> work, go with housemates <em>out</em> to a movie. Otherwise, you&#39;ll probably lose touch after leaving the job or house.</li>
      <li>Because everyone&#39;s a busy bee who lives in a rectangular beehive called a calendar, <em>regularly schedule friend-hangouts</em>. Make friendship a <em>habit</em>, for both of you!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Also, talk about your thoughts &amp; feelings with pals! Besides strengthening the friendship, I suspect sharing your feelings with another person improves your mental health the same way journaling does: explaining your emotions makes you understand your own emotions.</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúEvery first Monday of the month, I&#39;ll video-call my good friend who&#39;s in the distant, faraway land of New Haven, CT.‚Äù</em></p>

      <h3 id="toc_14">üé≥ Make New Friends</h3>

      <p>Option 1: Ask friends to introduce you to their friends. (e.g: you all go to a movie together)</p>

      <p>Option 2: Join a class or volunteer group or bowling league on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a>. (They&#39;re not paying me to say this.) I work independently and just moved to a new city, so it could&#39;ve been super lonely, but Meetup helped me make new friends fast! Just remember to also meet your new friends <em>outside</em> of the meetup.</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúEvery Thursday evening, I&#39;ll go to the French Meetup pour pratiquer mon terrible fran√ßais.‚Äù</em></p>

      <p>„Éª„Éª„Éª</p>

      <p>Finally ‚Äì our physical and social needs are essential, but we&#39;re not just social animals, we&#39;re <em>persons</em>. So, if your dog barks &quot;we&#39;re terrible, evil, broken!&quot;, you can reassure it with these habits:</p>

      <h2 id="toc_15">Habits to protect your &quot;becoming a better person&quot; needs:</h2>

      <p>The last decade of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology">&quot;the science of happiness&quot;</a> has been all about how happiness is not enough.</p>

      <p>Researchers now identify <a href="http://www.preptheday.com/uploads/1/2/0/0/120050120/hedonia_eudaimonia_and_well-being.pdf">two kinds of well-being [pdf]</a> ‚Äì <strong>Hedonia</strong>, which is pleasure &amp; fun, and <strong>Eudaimonia</strong>, which is purpose &amp; fulfillment. The two aren&#39;t opposed, but they are different. And of course, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronika_Huta/publication/23545617_Living_well_A_self-determination_theory_perspective_on_eudaimonia/links/546ce1330cf26e95bc3ca838/Living-well-A-self-determination-theory-perspective-on-eudaimonia.pdf">eudamonia predicts better psychological &amp; physical health [pdf]</a>.</p>

      <p>So, how do you find the meaning of life? Dunno, that&#39;s a question for philosophers. However, you can find <em>many</em> meaning(s) <em>in</em> life, like being a good friend, raising a child, volunteering for a cause... and pushing yourself to your fullest human potential, with habits like:</p>

      <p>Just pick <em>something</em> and set aside a day of the week (or hour of the day) to read a book, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice">deliberately practice</a> a skill.</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúEvery Sunday evening, I&#39;ll try cooking a new recipe.‚Äù</em></p>

      <p>Recommended: Spaced Repetition (&quot;flashcards on steroids&quot;) to help you remember what you learn. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVajQPuRmk8">this 7-minute video</a> or <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">this 80-minute long essay</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="toc_17">üòá ‚ÄúIt Builds Character‚Äù</h3>

      <p>Benjamin Franklin was the first lifehacker. In-between experimenting with lightning and fighting to abolish slavery, he also strived to improve his moral character with the help of... index cards. <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/ben-franklins-thirteen-virtues-using-one-week-to-change-your-life/">As described in his autobiography</a>: he carried a card with 7 columns ‚Äì one for each day of the week ‚Äì and 13 rows ‚Äì one for each Virtue he wanted to work on. At the end of each day, he&#39;d draw a dot for each Virtue he&#39;d successfully practiced that day. He failed a lot. But over time, he got the crooked timbre of his human nature a little less crooked.</p>

      <p>I think we all can, too. You don&#39;t have to use Franklin&#39;s exact method. In fact, I recommend being more specific than &quot;practice Humilty&quot;, and have a specific When‚ÜíThen plan, like:</p>

      <p><strong>Example When‚ÜíThen plan:</strong> <em>‚ÄúWhen I&#39;m about to post something angry on the internet, I will wait one hour before hitting Send.‚Äù</em></p>

      <p>‚ÄúBe the change you want to see in the world‚Äù etc etc.</p>

      <p>„Éª„Éª„Éª</p>

      <p>Know your wolf.<br>
      Physical needs.<br>
      Social needs.<br>
      Becoming a better person.</p>

      <p>What helps you meet <em>all</em> of these at the same time: <strong>making fear your friend.</strong> Building a healthier collaboration with your fear (know the wolf) will help you get better at protecting yourself (physical needs), be more vulnerable with trusted friends (social needs), and let you improve your moral character (&quot;becoming a better person&quot; needs).</p>

      <p>Hang on, my friend wants to say something:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>üê∫ Gah! We&#39;ve blabbered on for 3500+ words! How&#39;s a reader supposed to remember any of this?!</p>

      <p>Good point! Let&#39;s refresh the reader&#39;s memory with a summary:</p>
