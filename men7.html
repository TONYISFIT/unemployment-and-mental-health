    <h1 id="toc_19">Me &amp; My Wolf</h1>

<p>If this was a movie, I should&#39;ve learnt to befriend my wolf in a shocking moment of catharsis, with explosions in the background. That would have made a good story.</p>

<p>Instead, I only learnt to befriend my wolf <em>while trying</em> to make a good story.</p>

<p>When I started writing my game <em>Adventures With Anxiety</em>, I planned it to be a bunch of CBT &amp; mindfulness lessons wrapped up in a narrative. Two problems: 1) The story felt inauthentic. 2) I couldn&#39;t make the Anxiety character&#39;s dialogue come out naturally.</p>

<p>But then I realized an obvious solution for Problem #2: <em>I</em> shouldn&#39;t write the Anxiety character, my <em>anxiety</em> should write the Anxiety character.</p>

<p>Thus began a weird collaboration.</p>

<p>Strange side effect: I started <em>liking</em> my anxiety. Because now, whenever my anxiety went on a thought-spiral like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>üê∫ What can we even do that matters in the grand scheme of things? Contribute to humanity? All great works decay like Ozymandias. Love? Death always does it part. And how much death there is! We&#39;ll die, our loved ones will die, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics means even the <em>universe</em> will die! LIFE HAS NO MEANING, DEATH HAS NO MEANING, AND EVEN MEANING HAS NO MEANI‚Äì</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would think:</p>

<p>1) holy s*** that&#39;s terrifying<br>
2) this is <em>incredible</em> writing material! Thanks, wolf!</p>

<p>This also solved Problem #1: the reason the story felt forced was because I never gave the Anxiety character a real motivation. It was just a Skeletor-like &quot;evil for the sake of being evil&quot; enemy. But when I just <em>asked</em> my anxiety what its motivation was, it told me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>üê∫ I want you to be safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with that core motivation, <em>Adventures With Anxiety</em> basically wrote itself. Not only that, I learnt that why CBT &amp; mindfulness plateaued out for me: because I was still thinking of fear as my enemy.</p>

<p>Until you realize fear is (trying to be) your guard-dog, you will still fear fear itself.</p>

<p>And the more my battered shelter dog and I collaborated on the game, the more we collaborated in the rest of our life. I&#39;d hear it bark &quot;they hate us!&quot;, I&#39;d see the Pain signal below the mere words, and we&#39;d try an experiment to fulfill the unmet need. Together. As a team.</p>

<p>Alright, I think I&#39;ll let my friend have the final say. Wolf?</p>

<p>üê∫ Okay this article is <em>still</em> too long. It&#39;s 4000+ words! Or maybe it&#39;s not long <em>enough</em>, you didn&#39;t even cover other therapies like psychodynamic or humanist or logotherapy, let alone the Dodo Bird controversy: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735814001184">recent meta-analyses show that all the main psychotherapies are <em>equivalent</em></a>, with CBT maybe <em>sliiiiightly</em> better in the short-run! Speaking of which, what about the infamous meta-analysis that shows <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-11094-001">psychiatric medication may be up to 75% placebo</a>? Heck, what with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">the replication crisis</a>, how do we know <em>anything</em> in this 4000+ word monster is scientifically accurate?! Also we&#39;re writing this on the 15th, and you promised the game to come out on the 17th, so please shut up and stop writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough! It&#39;s good in science to be skeptical, though I&#39;d like to say: even if all therapies have been proven equivalent, they&#39;ve been proven equivalently <em>good</em>, and much better than lack of therapy (self-help or professional). And even if meds are only 25% better than placebo, being 25% better at saving lives is still a <em>lot</em>. Also, science is a process of learning from mistakes, and gratefully, scientists <em>are</em> learning from the replication crisis.</p>

<p>Still, thanks for the constructive criticism, and protecting my need for intellectual honesty!</p>

<p>üê∫ You&#39;re welcome. And, hey, thanks for finally being patient and understanding with me... instead of drowning me out with risky behaviors and &quot;Well, Actually&quot;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course! Any final words?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>üê∫ Yes. Just one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>üê∫ AAAAAHHHHH</p>
