      <p>I remember my first panic attack. I was at the bus stop. I&#39;d just moved to a new city, and the bus never showed up. So the little wolf in my brain said to me:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>üê∫ We&#39;re in a new place, and we can&#39;t even figure out how busses here work?</p>

      <p>üê∫ That means we won&#39;t be able to make friends! Or get home safely! Or buy things we need to survive!</p>

      <p>üê∫ Wait, why is our heart pounding? Why can&#39;t we breathe?! Aren&#39;t heart attacks in our family medical history?!?! Oh my god is this it?!?!?!</p>

      <p>üê∫ AAAAAHHHHH</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In 4 mental steps, a no-show bus had me 100% <em>convinced</em> I was going to die.</p>

      <p>So, that&#39;s why I never trusted the saying, &quot;trust your gut.&quot; Or, &quot;your feelings are valid.&quot; Imagine this scene:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Friend, to you: I feel worthless. I feel like a burden to everyone. I feel that deep down I&#39;m an irredeemably broken, evil person. </p>

      <p>You, to friend: Your feelings are valid! :D</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Thus, I trusted those <em>other</em> platitudes: &quot;Emotions are irrational.&quot; &quot;The only thing to fear is fear itself.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, be happy!&quot;</p>

      <p>So, I looked for ways to shut my fear up.</p>

      <p>It worked! I used random hookups and risky sex to drown out the sounds of my brain screaming. Finally, now that I paid no attention at all to my fear... I walked straight into several abusive and dangerous situations.</p>

      <p>(FUN FACT: In 1994, neuroscientists found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M._(patient)">a woman with both her amygdala destroyed</a>. She was the woman with no fear. No anxiety. No worries at all. That&#39;s why she&#39;s been victimized, mugged, and almost murdered several times.)</p>

      <p>Thankfully, my friends were afraid <em>for</em> me, when I was too afraid to let myself be afraid. (The only thing to fear is fear itself, right?) My pals helped me realize my situation <em>was</em> abusive, and got me out of it.</p>

      <p>A few months later, I heard the familiar voice of an old friend:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>üê∫ AAAAAHHHHH</p>
      </blockquote>
