    <p>To train a dog, first: don&#39;t beat the dog. Don&#39;t fear fear itself.</p>

    <p>So, what then, are you supposed to buy one of those clickers and train your own mind with operant conditioning?</p>

    <p>Well... yeah! Okay, dog clicker is optional. But, we have a word for when humans do operant conditioning on themselves:</p>

    <p><strong>Habits.</strong></p>

    <p>Here&#39;s a quick summary of the science of forming habits, <a href="https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/62/605/664.full.pdf">paraphrased from the British Journal of General Practice [pdf]</a>:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Habit = When X, Then Y.</strong><br>
    X is the &quot;cue&quot;, Y is the &quot;routine&quot;. Example: &quot;when I come out of the shower, then I will floss my teeth.&quot;</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>To build a habit, have a consistent When.</strong><br>
    Example: if you&#39;re trying to eat healthier, don&#39;t just say &quot;I&#39;ll eat more fruits&quot;. Give yourself a <em>specific time and/or place,</em> like, &quot;after I have lunch at home I will have a piece of fruit&quot;. (Also known in psychology as an <a href="http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10101/99Goll_ImpInt.pdf">Implementation Intention. [pdf]</a>)</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>To build a habit, have a simple Then.</strong><br>
    Example: if you&#39;re new to meditation, <em>don&#39;t</em> start with &quot;meditate for 30 minutes a day.&quot; Start with &quot;meditate for 2 minutes a day.&quot; Once 2 minutes becomes habit, <em>then</em> you can increase it. </p></li>
    <li><p><strong>To <em>break</em> a habit, change the When or Then:</strong><br>
    Example: to stop myself from procrastinating, I use apps to block tempting websites. (Odysseus tied himself to the mast to resist the sirens&#39; song.)</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Track your progress.</strong><br>
    Personally: for each day I successfully do my When‚ÜíThen plan, I draw an ‚≠ï on a calendar. If I fail, I draw an ‚ùå.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Do NOT try building more than one habit at a time.</strong>    </p></li>
    <li><p><strong>It takes 66 days (on average) for a habit to become automatic.</strong><br>
    Be patient! Mind-training takes time, but it&#39;s worth it.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hang on, my guard dog wants to say something:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>üê∫ We just spent 1800+ words and we haven&#39;t <em>actually</em> given the reader any practical mental health tips! We&#39;re wasting their time!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&#39;s a good concern! I&#39;ll add a link at the top to let readers skip to the Mental Health Habits sections. Speaking of which:</p>
