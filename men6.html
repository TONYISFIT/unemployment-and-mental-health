<ul>
<li><strong>Do not fear fear itself.</strong></li>
<li>Pain is a protector. </li>
<li>Fear is a guard dog for your needs.</li>
<li><strong>All feelings are imperfect signals about met/unmet needs.</strong></li>
<li>Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, &quot;becoming a better person&quot; needs.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy people don&#39;t &quot;cope&quot; with emotions, they <em>collaborate</em> with them. They use &quot;negative&quot; emotions as clues, constructive criticism to improve their lives.</strong></li>
<li>If your fear guard-dog is too hyperactive, don&#39;t shoot the dog! Retrain it by forming habits.</li>
<li><strong>Habit = When X, Then Y.</strong> </li>
<li>To form habits, have a consistent &quot;When&quot; and simple &quot;Then&quot;. Track your progress for ~66 days. One habit at a time.</li>
<li>Physical health affects mental health &amp; vice versa. Hardware affects software, software affects hardware.</li>
<li><strong>9 Mental Health Habits for your software &amp; hardware:</strong> Meditation, Journaling, Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Talk with friends, Make new friends, Learning, Practicing virtues.</li>
