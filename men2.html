    <h1 id="toc_1">Therapies I Tried</h1>

      <p>If this was a movie, that should&#39;ve been the point I realized the value of fear.</p>

      <p>Nope. I learnt nothing.</p>

      <p>It did, however, inspire me to <em>finally</em> try psychotherapy. I first tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT), which <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/da.20829">meta-analyses have shown</a> is as good or better than medications for depression &amp; anxiety. The therapy recommends &quot;challenging your thoughts&quot; by pointing out all the irrational &quot;cognitive distortions&quot; in your fears. (ü§ì ‚ÄúWell, <em>Actually</em>...‚Äù)</p>

      <p>CBT helped me a lot, but I quickly hit a plateau. My problem was I used CBT as a <em>weapon</em> against my fear. I still thought of fear as my <em>enemy</em>.</p>

      <p>Next, I tried a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness</a>-based therapy ‚Äì specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy">Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy</a> ‚Äì which recommends <em>not</em> fighting your thoughts, but just letting your feelings pass by. (Metaphor I was told: anxiety&#39;s like quicksand ‚Äì the more you struggle, the quicker you sink. Therefore: don&#39;t struggle.)</p>

      <p>Again, I used mindfulness as just another way to <em>ignore</em> my fear. Fear was <em>still</em> my enemy.</p>

      <p>It took me a <em>decade</em> to finally figure it out, but fear is‚Äì‚Äì</p>

      <p>Hang on, my wolf wants to say something:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>üê∫ Nicky, CBT and mindfulness have helped <em>millions</em> of people, and are backed by <em>hundreds</em> of studies. Who are <em>we</em> to poop all over what saves peoples&#39; <em>lives?!</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Thanks, wolf! That&#39;s a very good concern you&#39;ve brought up.</p>

      <p>I want to clarify: CBT and mindfulness <em>does</em> help people. They helped <em>me</em> immensely.</p>

      <p>But no technique will fully work if you believe that fear is an <em>enemy</em> to be &quot;overcome&quot; or &quot;conquered&quot;. Or an annoying thing to &quot;mindfully&quot; put up with. As I was saying earlier: it took me a decade to finally figure it out, but fear is not an enemy.</p>

      <p>Fear is a <em>friend.</em></p>
